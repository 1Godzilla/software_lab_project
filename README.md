# Lab Software Development Projects

This project involves setting up a comprehensive software development environment (SDE) and creating scripts in various languages. By following the steps outlined here, you will gain hands-on experience with essential programming tools and languages.

## Project Objectives

- Set up a versatile software development environment.
- Install essential software and programming languages.
- Write and execute scripts in Python, Ruby, PowerShell, C, and PHP.
- Validate the correct installation and functionality of each component.

## Prerequisites

Before beginning, ensure you have the following installed:

- **VSCode**: for code editing.
- **Python**: for scripting.
- **Ruby**: for scripting.
- **Microsoft PowerShell**: for running Windows-based scripts.
- **C Compiler (e.g., GCC)**: for compiling C programs.
- **XAMPP Server**: for hosting and running PHP scripts locally.

## Steps

### 1. Install Software

Download and install the following software to set up your development environment:

- [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/)
- [Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
- [Ruby](https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/downloads/)
- [Microsoft PowerShell](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/scripting/install/installing-powershell)
- [GCC (for C compilation)](https://gcc.gnu.org/install/)
- [XAMPP](https://www.apachefriends.org/download.html)

### 2. Script Creation

Write and save the following scripts in their respective languages:

- **Python Script**: Prints the Python version to the console.
  ```python
  import sys
  print("Python Version:", sys.version)
